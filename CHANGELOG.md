# Changelog

## v1.1.1

- fixes a bug where the "save as" command does not append the .wallet extension
- fixes a bug where the user could still save the wallet in the install directory by placing it in a subfolder, causing the wallet file to be wiped on wallet upgrade
- electron-builder updated for MacOS Catalina compatability
- updates GH builds to use latest OS and cache the dependencies
- upgrades the wallet backend to alleviate a bug that was (possibly) effecting sending transactions
- Slight configuration change in an attempt to make the sync process not effect the GUI responsiveness so much

## v1.1.0

- Adds a new method of making new wallets, which is much more interactive, and ensures the user backs up their seed before they use their wallet.
- Adds an addressbook.
- Makes several updates to the send form to integrate with the new address book. You can now enter a contact name or turtlecoin address in the send field, and it will autosuggest matching contacts as you type.
- Adds a search feature. Currently you can search contacts (name or address), transactions (hash, block height, or payment ID), and settings (name, description, or keywords).
- Fixes a bug that would cause the wallet syncing to slow drastically when window was hidden or minimized.
- Fixes a bug that would cause the user to be unable to backup the wallet if it was a non-deterministic wallet.
- Fixes a but that would allow exporting transactions as CSV when the wallet was locked.
- Switches the node changer to use the built in swapNode() method.
- Removes the ability to actually launch the TurtleCoind process, but still allows tailing a log file: I found that actually having Proton launch the child process itself was not the functionality I was really looking for, I was just looking to be able to view my terminal output in Proton for both the daemon and the backend. So, I removed the launching of the process, but it still allows you to set a log file location and view the tail of the text file in the Terminal tab.
- Switches to GitHub actions for push and PR building / release deployment rather than using travis (much faster, windows build is ~6 min compared to almost 30)

## v1.0.0

- There is user action required for this update. The wallet open dialog now **only looks for wallet files ending in the `.wallet` extension,** as well as uses this extension by default when saving. If your wallet file does not have this extension, you will not be able to see it in the open dialog. **You must manually rename your wallet file and give it the proper extension `.wallet`**.
- Adds quite a few nifty animations.
- Adds integrated address generation on the Receive screen.
- Fixes a nasty memory leak that somehow I did not notice on the last version.
- Fixes some UX bugs that were missed from transitioning to non-blocking modal components rather than native dialogs.
- Increases the amount of sockets available to request to fix timeout bugs.
- All drop down menus are now fully searchable, keyboard navigable, and ARIA compliant.
- WalletBackend logs are now viewable in the terminal tab, and there is a component under Wallet settings that allows you to set the log level.
- Uncaught errors now display in an error component for the user instead of crashing the renderer process
- You can now disable and enable notifications in OS Settings.

Also, following this release, Proton will be moving to a **monthly release cycle**. We will have a new version out W1 of each month for you to download, so no more of these incredibly frequent update notifications (apologies if they've been bothersome).

Thanks TurtleCoin community, and please enjoy the new version!

## v0.0.28

- introduces a non-blocking in-window 'modal' component which replaces all native (thread blocking) dialogs
- adds a local daemon mode which can be enabled in settings (you must provide a path to turtlecoind)
- upgrades turtlecoin-wallet-backend for some transaction bugfixes
- adds some additional dev-only testing actions
- pulls in source code pro for monospace font on all OS

## v0.0.27

- reverts the default remote node change from v0.0.26

## v0.0.26

- transaction errors should now be fixed or at least 95% reduced (thanks zpalm and ibmcd for your assistance troubleshooting)
- fixes a bug where auto-optimizing was not occurring
- indicator on the lock screen that your wallet is locked, not just logged out, as well as its sync status
- ability to disable and configure the time of the autolock (in the settings menu)
- ability to display transactions in fiat value (click on your balance on the bottom right)
- completely redesigned settings menu
- "find node" link updated to the new official TurtleCoin node finder (https://explorer.turtlecoin.lol/nodes.html)
- some various UI improvements
- updated to latest version of wallet-backend
- "test" transaction button for developers (sends a transaction between 0.01 - 1.00 with a fee of 0.1 and a random payment ID to the primary wallet addresss)
- possibly other things I am forgetting
- changed default remote node to one run by the developer (as always, you can change the node in settings)

This should hopefully fix most of the transaction issues everybody has been having. There are still times that a daemon is busy syncing and may not respond to your request. In the event of this, you should just wait a little while and retry your request. If it continuosly fails, it is likely an issue with the node, so please select another node.

If you have a wallet with bad inputs, make sure you "rescan" your wallet in settings. This should hopefully be the last time you have to do this, as you should no longer receive bad inputs in your wallet.

Thanks everybody and enjoy the new version.
